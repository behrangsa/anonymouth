My dear Theo,

I'm writing to you from Arles in the south of France. The sun here is magnificent,
and I've been painting the orchards in bloom. The trees are covered in blossoms,
and the sky is a bright blue. It's a sight that fills me with joy and hope.

I've rented a small yellow house where I hope to establish an artists' colony.
Gauguin will be joining me soon. The light here is extraordinary - it transforms
everything it touches. I'm working with a new intensity, producing a painting
almost every day.

The people here are different too - more colorful, more alive. I've been painting
the postman and his family. There's a simplicity in their lives that speaks to me.

I feel that I'm finally creating work that matters. The colors sing, the brushwork
vibrates with energy. This is what I was meant to do.

Your loving brother,
Vincent
