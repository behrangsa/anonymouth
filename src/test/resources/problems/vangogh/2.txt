My dearest Theo,

I write to you from the asylum at Saint-Rémy, where the days pass slowly and my mind struggles to find peace. The attack I suffered in Arles has left me shaken, and I fear what it means for my future as an artist.

The doctors here speak of my condition in terms I don't fully understand. They say I must rest, that I must not excite myself with too much painting. But how can I rest when the cypresses outside my window twist and dance in the wind, begging to be captured on canvas? How can I be still when the wheat fields beyond the garden wall shimmer with golden light?

I have been allowed to paint again, though under supervision. The irises in the garden have become my obsession - their purple petals seem to pulse with life, and I find myself losing hours trying to capture their essence. In these moments of creation, the darkness in my mind recedes, and I remember who I am.

You asked in your last letter about my ear. The wound has healed, but the memory of that night haunts me. I cannot explain what drove me to such desperation. It was as if another person had taken control of my body, someone filled with rage and sorrow I could not contain.

The other patients here are kind, in their way. We are all broken souls seeking healing. Some days I feel hopeful, as if the sun might break through the clouds that surround my thoughts. Other days, the weight of my illness presses down like a stone, and I wonder if I will ever be whole again.

Please do not worry too much about me, dear brother. Art is still my salvation. When I paint, I am not a madman - I am Vincent, and my brush speaks truths that my wounded mind cannot express in words.

Give my love to Jo and little Vincent. Perhaps someday I will be well enough to meet my nephew.

Your devoted brother,
Vincent

Saint-Rémy, May 1889
