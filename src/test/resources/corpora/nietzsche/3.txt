Dear Georg Brandes,

Your work on Shakespeare has opened new horizons for me. I find myself returning to
your insights as I develop my own thoughts on the Ãœbermensch. The concept is
misunderstood - it is not about superiority but about transcendence, about creating
new values beyond good and evil.

I see in Shakespeare's characters a prefiguration of this idea. They live beyond
conventional morality, creating their own meaning in a chaotic world. This is the
future of humanity - not the herd morality that dominates our age, but the courage
to create one's own values.

Copenhagen would be fortunate to have you lecture on these matters. I urge you to
consider it, though I understand the difficulties. The world needs voices that
challenge the comfortable assumptions of our time.

With profound respect,
Friedrich Nietzsche
