Turin, 30 October 1883

My dear Overbeck,

I write to you from Turin, where I have found a temporary refuge.
The mountains here remind me of Sils Maria, but the Italian sun
gives them a different character.

I must tell you about the profound change that has come over me.
The death of Wagner was a liberation - it broke the last chain
that bound me to my past. I feel like a man who has awakened from
a long dream to find himself in a new world.

My work on Zarathustra progresses. The third part is complete,
and I have begun the fourth. This work consumes me utterly.
Sometimes I feel as if I am merely the vessel through which
these ideas flow. The concept of the Ãœbermensch grows clearer
each day - not as some biological advancement, but as a spiritual
ideal that humanity must strive toward.

The loneliness is crushing at times. But solitude is the price
one pays for seeing what others cannot. I have learned that
greatness requires isolation - the eagle flies alone.

How are things in Basel? Do you still find satisfaction in your
work? Give my regards to your dear wife.

Yours in thought,
F.N.
