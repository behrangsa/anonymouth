My beloved Constanze,

I write to you with a heavy heart, though I try to maintain the cheerful disposition you so love in me. Our financial situation has become most dire, and I find myself in the humiliating position of having to ask friends for loans once again.

The commissions have been few this month, and what little money we had has been spent on necessities. I have pawned my watch - the one my father gave me - and still we struggle to pay for food and rent. It pains me deeply to see you worry so, especially in your delicate condition.

I have been working feverishly on my Piano Concerto No. 27, hoping that a successful performance might bring us some relief. The music flows from my pen with such ease, yet why must the business of music be so difficult? Sometimes I wonder if God has cursed me with this gift, to create such beauty while living in such poverty.

Please do not despair, my darling. I have faith that our circumstances will improve. Perhaps the Emperor will commission another opera, or some wealthy patron will recognize the value of my work. Until then, we must endure with the same courage that has carried us through so many trials.

I think often of our early days together, when love seemed enough to conquer any hardship. That love sustains me still, even as the world seems to conspire against us. Your unwavering faith in my abilities gives me strength to continue composing, even when doubt creeps into my mind.

Kiss our dear Karl Thomas for me. I hope to return to you soon with better news and perhaps a few coins in my pocket.

Your devoted husband,
Wolfgang

Vienna, 1788
