My dearest Father,

I write to you from Prague with the most joyful news! The premiere of my opera "Don Giovanni" has been a tremendous success, beyond what I had dared to hope. The audience was enraptured from the very first note, and the applause thundered through the theater like a mighty storm.

You know how I have labored over this work, wrestling with Da Ponte's libretto to find the perfect musical expression for each dramatic moment. The character of Don Giovanni himself has proven to be one of my most challenging creations - a man both seductive and damned, requiring music that could capture his magnetic charm while never letting us forget his ultimate fate.

The orchestra performed magnificently under my direction. I was particularly pleased with how the final scene unfolded - the supernatural appearance of the Commendatore and Don Giovanni's descent into hell. The audience sat in stunned silence during these moments, and I could feel their very souls trembling with the power of the music.

My dear Constanze has been such a support during these trying weeks of preparation. She understands the burden I carry as a composer, always striving to create something worthy of the divine gift I have been given. I pray that this success will finally bring us the financial security we have so desperately needed.

I hope this letter finds you in good health, dearest Father. Your guidance in my musical education has made all of this possible. I remain forever grateful for your wisdom and patience during my turbulent youth.

Please give my love to dear Nannerl. I hope to see you both soon when I return to Vienna.

Your devoted son,
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart

Prague, October 1787
