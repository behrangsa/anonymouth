My dearest Nannerl,

I write to you in what may be my final letter, though I pray it will not be so. My health has been failing these past months, and I find myself contemplating mortality in ways I never imagined in my youth. Yet even as my body weakens, my mind remains sharp, and the music continues to flow through me with an intensity that both amazes and frightens me.

I have been working on a Requiem Mass, commissioned by a mysterious stranger who appeared at my door dressed in gray. Perhaps it is fitting that I should compose my own funeral music, for I feel death's cold hand upon my shoulder with each passing day. The "Lacrimosa" movement haunts me - those tears of mourning seem to weep from my very soul onto the manuscript paper.

Do you remember, dear sister, how we used to play together as children? You were always the more disciplined musician, while I was prone to flights of fancy and improvisation. Father was so proud of us both, his musical prodigies traveling across Europe. Those were simpler times, when music was pure joy and not the burden it has sometimes become.

I have also completed my Piano Concerto No. 27, perhaps my most mature work in that form. There is a melancholy to it that mirrors my current state, yet also a transcendent beauty that I hope will outlive these mortal concerns. Music, after all, is the language of the eternal, and perhaps through my compositions, something of Wolfgang will persist beyond this earthly existence.

Constanze has been my angel through these dark days. She tends to me with such devotion, even as I grow more difficult and morose. Our little Karl Thomas brings light to my dimming world with his innocent laughter. I pray that whatever musical gifts I possess might one day manifest in him, though I hope he will find an easier path than his father has walked.

If this should be my final correspondence, know that you have always held a special place in my heart. You understood my music in ways that few others could, and your own talents deserved far more recognition than the world was willing to give a woman, no matter how gifted.

Give my love to our father if you see him in the world beyond. Tell him that his son never forgot the lessons he taught about dedication, discipline, and the sacred responsibility of the artist.

Your loving brother,
Wolfgang Amadeus

Vienna, December 1791
